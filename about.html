    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            I am a student at the University of Oklahoma pursuing a BBA in both Accounting and 
            Management Information Systems. I am also wanting to pursue a Master's in Accounting.

            I am proficient in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as developing 
            programming skills in Visual Studio. Along with these skills, I have a strong work 
            ethic, am highly motivated, am a great problem solver, and am always ready to learn 
            something new. I am always seeking ways to grow professionally, personally, and 
            academically.

            I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can put my technical skills to 
            the test in the fields of accounting and management information systems.
