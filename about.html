    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Laura Goon and I am currently a senior at the University of Oklahoma.
        I am an Accounting and MIS double major looking to pursue an accounting focused career.
        I am excited as I look to pursue a Master in Accounting in Fall 2022 and take the steps to receive
        my CPA license.

        I made the decision to pursue a degree in accounting because I love working with numbers and the logical
        thinking that is required in the field. Pursuing MIS came about during my freshman year of college when I took
        my first MIS course. I decided to pair the two majors together because technology is ever changing and will
        continue to be a huge part of every industry of work in the future.
