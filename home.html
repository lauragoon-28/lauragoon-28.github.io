    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Laura Goon and I am currently a senior at the University of Oklahoma.
        I am an Accounting and MIS double major looking to pursue an accounting focused career.
        I am excited as I look to pursue a Master in Accounting in Fall 2022 and take the steps to receive
        my CPA license.
